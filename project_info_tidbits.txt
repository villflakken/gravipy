 ORIGAMI summer project 2017 ----> Master's project
 ---------------------------
    This goal of this project will be to learn how to interact with N-body simulation data, especially halo catalogs.


    The student will:
    * submit jobs to a cluster to run a subhalo finder on 100s of N-body simulations; 

    * research available merger tree codes and identify a suitable public code to run on these halo catalogs;

    * and write functions to read simulation data (particle positions and velocities, halo tables, and particle IDs within halos) in python.


    If available, the student may also test a prototype of the “FileDB” database framework to interact with the simulation data in both python and SQL.
